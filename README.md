Inverted Search Engine
Overview
Welcome to the Inverted Search Engine project, a powerful tool for efficient and flexible search capabilities. This project implements an inverted index-based search system, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of information from large datasets. Inverted search is particularly useful for scenarios where traditional search methods may be suboptimal, such as searching through extensive textual or document-based collections.

Features
Inverted Indexing: Utilizes an inverted index data structure to map terms to their corresponding document IDs, significantly accelerating search operations.

Query Expansion: Enhances search precision through query expansion techniques, improving the relevance of search results.

Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets with ease, allowing seamless scaling for projects of varying sizes.

Customizable Ranking Algorithms: Enables users to implement and fine-tune ranking algorithms, tailoring the search experience to specific requirements.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides a straightforward and intuitive interface for users to input queries and receive relevant results.
